/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Predictatron
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and predictions, while allowing public read access to events and leaderboard entries.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile data. Publicly readable for leaderboards, but only the owner can write.
 * - /events/{eventId}: Event data, publicly readable, but write access is not defined in the current rule set and thus defaults to none.
 * - /users/{userId}/predictions/{predictionId}: User-specific predictions, accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - /leaderboard/{leaderboardEntryId}: Leaderboard entries, publicly readable, but write access is not defined in the current rule set and thus defaults to none.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is publicly readable to populate leaderboards and profiles.
 * - User data write access is strictly private and accessible only to the owning user.
 * - Events and leaderboard data are publicly readable to facilitate app functionality.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Prediction` entity includes the `userId` field, which is redundant given the path structure (/users/{userId}/predictions/{predictionId}). However, this redundancy simplifies the rules and avoids needing to rely on the path for authorization checks within the document itself (e.g., during updates). This is important because `request.resource.data` represents the merged document state on updates, not just the path parameters.
